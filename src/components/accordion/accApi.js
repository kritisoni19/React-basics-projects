        questions:'Why was virtual DOM introduced?',
        answer:'DOM manipulation is an integral part of any web application, but DOM manipulation is quite slow when compared to other operations in JavaScript. The efficiency of the application gets affected when several DOM manipulations are being done. Most JavaScript frameworks update the entire DOM even when a small part of the DOM changes.'

        questions:'What are props in React?',
        answer:'The props in React are the inputs to a component of React. They can be single-valued or objects having a set of values that will be passed to components of React during creation by using a naming convention that almost looks similar to HTML-tag attributes. We can say that props are the data passed from a parent component into a child component.'
